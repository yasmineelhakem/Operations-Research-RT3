# Research Operations Project
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of two complex operations research problems:

1. Linear Problem: Multi-Production Planning Problem (involving multiple products across multiple periods)
2. Linear Mixed Problem:  Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)

The project uses <b> Gurobi </b> , a powerful optimization solver, to model and solve these problems. 
The user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the models and visualizing results are built with <b> Streamlit </b>.
